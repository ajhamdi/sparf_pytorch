The official Pytroch code of the paper [SPARF: Large-Scale Learning of 3D Sparse Radiance Fields from Few Input Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09100). SPARF is a large-scale sparse radiance field dataset consisting of ~ 1 million SRFs with multiple voxel resolutions (32, 128, and 512) and 17 million posed images with a resolution of 400 X 400. Furthermore, we propose SuRFNet, a pipline to generate SRFs conditioned on input images, achieving SOTA on ShapeNet novel views synthesis from one or few input images.
